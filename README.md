# Job-Search-Automation
The process of searching for jobs involves a lot of tedious tasks, with this program I try do make it a little less tedious.

What does the program do?
1. It creates a folder structure based on the company name and the title of the jobposting you give it.
2. It copies The documents in you Standard folder in my standard folder I have my CV and Coverletter, but you can have the content that fits you the best
3. After the Standard folder content is copied to the folder to the folder structure, the program will find and replace the placeholder name '____', with the Company name.
4. Then the documents are converted to pdf so they are ready to be sent.
5. Finally the program will Create a copy of the jobposting for safekeeping so you can prepare for the interview.

Step 5 is not working properly, it does what it should, but it tend to run into errors that confuses the program so it doesn't stop like intended.
I'm looking into a better solution that will save space and work faster.
A lot of stuff is hardcoded and I will change that soon so the program is easier to move to another computer.
